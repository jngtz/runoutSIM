# A development workspace for runoutSim
The /Dev folder contains development scripts that make it easier for users to explore, modify, and test the code without needing to rebuild the entire R package each time. This is especially useful for iterating quickly or experimenting with new features.

To get started, use the runoutSim_Dev_example.R script. It sources all necessary functions using source() calls, allowing you to load everything into your environment and run examples or simulations immediatelyâ€”no package installation required.
