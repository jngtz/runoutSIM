# Development Workspace for `runoutSim`

The `/Dev` folder provides development scripts designed to help users explore, modify, and test the `runoutSim` codebase without needing to rebuild the entire R package each time. This setup is especially useful for rapid iteration and experimentation with new features.

## Getting Started

To begin, use the `runoutSim_Dev_example.R` script. It sources all required functions using `source()` calls, allowing you to load the code directly into your R environment. This means you can run examples or simulations immediatelyâ€”no package installation required.

## Data

The `data` folder includes:

- Debris flow polygons and source points  
- A digital elevation model (DEM)  
- Basin stream channels  
- A QGIS project file for easy visualization and exploration  

These datasets can be used to test the simulation and experiment with different parameters or inputs.
