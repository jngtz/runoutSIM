\title{Convert Random Walk Results to Raster}
\usage{
walksToRaster(x, dem, weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of runout simulation outputs (e.g., from \code{runoutSim()}).}

\item{dem}{A \code{SpatRaster} object representing the reference DEM.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights (same length as \code{x}) to scale traverse frequencies.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatRaster} with cell values representing weighted or unweighted traverse frequencies.
}
\description{
Aggregates output from \code{runoutSim()} into a raster showing how often each
cell was traversed during runout simulations. Optionally weights each walk
by a supplied vector (e.g., probability of initiation).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Convert simulated paths to a raster of transition frequencies
paths_raster <- walksToRaster(sim_paths, dem)
plot(paths_raster)
}
