\title{Estimate Probability of Source-Feature Connectivity}
\usage{
sourceConnect(sim_paths, feature_mask, trials = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sim_paths}{A list of matrices, each containing (row, col) indices of cells visited by a simulation path.}

\item{feature_mask}{A binary matrix indicating presence (\code{1}) of a connectivity feature (from \code{makeConnFeature()}).}

\item{trials}{Optional integer specifying how many simulation paths to consider. Defaults to all paths.}
}
\value{
A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the estimated probability of connection.
}
\description{
Calculates the proportion of simulated paths (e.g., from random walk runout simulations)
that intersect a binary connectivity feature mask.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
p_connect <- sourceConnect(sim_paths, feature_mask, trials = 1000)
}
