The `runoutSIM` R package is developed for regional-scale runout simulations using random walks. It currently can be used to estimate the spatial distribution and velocity (via [Perla et al's](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/twoparameter-model-of-snowavalanche-motion/B87923FFC6ADAF61B0079EEBCBD96F19) two-parameter friction model) of:
* Debris flows
* Snow avalanches
